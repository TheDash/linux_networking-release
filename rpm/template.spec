use with a wireless network adapter running in master mode. It implements the
dynamic_reconfigure interface defined in the [[access_point_control]] package.

# In case we're installing to a non-standard location, look for a setup.sh
# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
